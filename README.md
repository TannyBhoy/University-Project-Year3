Structures &amp; Algorithms in Java - Coursework
The coursework i am doing involves a second hand car dealership which has many makes of cars (e.g. Ford, Toyota, Volkswagen) on
sale at any one time. They would like a system which holds information on all the current makes of cars, as well as details of each of the cars of that make.
